### Elevator Predictive Maintenance System

This project focuses on monitoring elevator components in real-time and predicting maintenance dates to enhance safety and minimize downtime. By collecting data from various sensors and utilizing machine learning, the system efficiently identifies maintenance needs and prevents failures.

#### Features:

1.  **Real-Time Data Collection**

    -   Sensors used: Accelerometer, Infrared (IR), DHT (temperature and humidity), and sound sensors.
    -   Monitors environmental conditions, steel rope wear, and brake speed.
2.  **Predictive Maintenance**

    -   Developed a Random Forest model with 95% accuracy to forecast service dates.
    -   Proactively identifies maintenance needs to avoid unexpected breakdowns.
3.  **Real-Time Monitoring**

    -   Integrated a Flask server with Arduino for real-time data communication.
    -   Built a user-friendly frontend app to monitor component health and service requirements.
4.  **Results**

    -   Reduced downtime by 30%.
    -   Improved safety by addressing maintenance needs in advance.

#### Technical Details:

-   **Machine Learning**: Random Forest model for predictions.
-   **Backend**: Flask server for handling sensor data and predictions.
-   **Hardware**: Arduino board connected to sensors.
-   **Frontend**: Real-time app to display the health status of components.

#### Impact:

This project successfully minimized elevator downtime and improved safety, showcasing the potential of predictive maintenance systems in preventing failures and optimizing operations.
